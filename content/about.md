### Hello

My name is Waldemar Bira, I live in Poland, and I’m a Software Engineer that is passionate about AWS. Currently I'm work in Ryanair Labs in their Wrocław office, and on my daily basis I'm working on project in serverless architecture written in Go. 

In my spear time I'm preparing for triathlon competitions. In this year my goal is to complete Half Ironman distance. I also like hiking and from time to time I brew beer in my home :)
